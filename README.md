# Personality-Prediction-System
The Personality Prediction System is a machine learning–based application designed to analyze user input data and predict an individual’s personality type. The system processes behavioral and psychological attributes (such as responses to questions, habits, and preferences) and classifies the personality into predefined categories using a trained classification model.

The application includes a user-friendly interface where users can enter their details or questionnaire responses. The backend model, trained on a labeled personality dataset, performs preprocessing, feature scaling, and prediction to generate the personality type in human-readable form (e.g., Introvert, Extrovert, Ambivert). The trained model is serialized and integrated into the application for real-time predictions.

This system demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It can be applied in domains like career guidance, recruitment screening, psychological assessment, and personalized recommendations.
